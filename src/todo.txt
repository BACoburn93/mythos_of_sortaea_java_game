--------------------------------------------

Create a dynamic class that adds ability based on the item's tier/enemy level
    Pull from a pool of abilities and select a number of abilities that are <= item tier
        This will be for Prefix/Suffix logic
    Consider doing the same for Enemy logic when determining abilities gained from Prefix/Suffix
        Enemy level (after prefix/suffix application) will be considered, as opposed to item tier
