--------------------------------------------

Create a dynamic class that adds ability based on the item's tier/enemy level (done)
    Pull from a pool of abilities and select a number of abilities that are <= item tier (done)
        This will be for Prefix/Suffix logic
    Consider doing the same for Enemy logic when determining abilities gained from Prefix/Suffix (done)
        Enemy level (after prefix/suffix application) will be considered, as opposed to item tier (done)
        Find a way to restrict abilities to specific enemy base types (Working on)
            I.E. Only a Dragon base type will have access to Dragonbreath of a certain type
                The Prefix/Suffix which includes specific types of Dragonbreath abilities can only be 
                applied to a Dragon base type
                Red when applied to Dragon will provide a Dragonfire Breath attack
                When applied to anything else, the ability will be ignored for consideration
